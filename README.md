#IGUANA

## Requirements
IGUANA requires the Maven build automation tool, and JDK 7 (or more recent) installed.

## Installation
To install IGUANA you need to check out the repository, and run the following command to produce a JAR file (or run the equivalent command in your IDE):

`mvn package`

You'll then need to set the following environment variables. 

* The `IGUANA_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the root directory of this repository, where it is checked out on your system.
* The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable needs to be set to the root directory of your JDK installation.
* You need to update your `CLASSPATH` environment variable to the JAR file (that includes dependent libraries) produced by Maven. Typically this lives in the `target` directory and is called `iguanatool-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. So in Bash, you will need to use the command:

`export CLASSPATH="$IGUANA_HOME/target/iguanatool-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar":$CLASSPATH`

## Compiling Case Studies
You will need to create a directory for your case studies (test objects/subjects). The easiest way to do this with the required structure is to clone the `casestudies` repository (https://github.com/iguanatool/casestudies).

To install a new case study you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a new directory for your case study in the `c` subdirectory of your casestudies directory, e.g. `calendar` and place the code (functions you want to test) in there in a file called `calendar.c`
2. Perform step one assimilation, by running the following command
`java org.iguanatool.Assimilate calendar`
(replace `calendar` with your own case study name)
3. Edit the input specification Java class code for each function to be tested that has been produced in the `casestudies/java/calendar/inputspecifications` directory
4. Each case study becomes a part of the IGUANA code, so you'll now need to compile IGUANA again, using `mvn package`
5. Complete the call code for each C file for each function to be tested in the `casestudies/c/calendar/call` directory
6. Perform step two assimilation, by again running `java org.iguanatool.Assimilate calendar`

Your case study should be ready to go.

## Running Test Data Generation
Running test data generation is then as simple as a command such as

`java org.iguanatool.Run calendar nhc`

where calendar is the case study and nhc is the search. (Search names are derived from the method names in the org.iguanatool.search.SearchFactory class.

Further configuration options can be set through the `iguana.config` file in IGUANA's root directory. Each of these can be overridden at the command line by preceeding the option with a dash. For example, to set the seed from the command line, use

`java org.iguanatool.Run calendar nhc -seed=100`
